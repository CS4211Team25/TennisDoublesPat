# Data Extraction

This directory contains all the files for data extraction.

`main.py` calculates the results of the players' hits, classified by hit type, stroke type and hit position, and outputs the results to `main_out.txt`.

`orientation.py` calculates the number of times each player returns from each position, and outputs the results to `orientations_out.txt`.

`orientation2.py` and `orientation3.py` calculate some other metrics that were not used in the final project. The outputs can still be seen in `orientations_out2.txt` and `orientations_out3.txt`.

`winPoints.py` calculates the number of winning points for each team based on the hit type and the position. The output can be seen in `win_points_out.txt`.
